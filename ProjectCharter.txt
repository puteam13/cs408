	scoreboard, while keeping a personal best.

Project Objectives: 
	1. Create ten puzzle maze type levels 
	2. Keep track of score based on time completion, objects hit, and object picked up
	3. Store the scores in a local database
	4. Enhance users' analytical skills and creativity

Stakeholders: 
The stakeholders are the users of the game.

Project Deliverables:
	A program that will generate a maze type level that a user can navigate
	through trying to pick up items and solve puzzles along the way, while
	avoiding obstacles. The game will also keep track of your score.
